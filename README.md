# Random Snaking Image Recursion
Just as the title implies, this program generates an image of snake-like lines by recursively generating random numbers. 

# Motivation
This project was completed as part of my high school's (Choate Rosemary Hall) AP Computer Science curriculum. I took AP CS in the 2015-2016 school year when the curriculum still used Java. The purpose of this project was to practice using recursion and Java's graphic capabilities.

# How to Use?
Just compile and run. Make sure you have Java installed. 

# Credits
I would like to thank Ms. Healey for teaching AP CS and giving me the knowledge to write this code.
